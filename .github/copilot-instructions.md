This is a React frontend for a Django background job system. The app should:

- Display a paginated dashboard of jobs (with real-time status updates via WebSocket)
- Provide forms to create email and file upload jobs (immediate or scheduled)
- Route to the dashboard after job creation
- Use modern React (hooks, functional components), React Router, and a clean UI
- Use the backend REST API and WebSocket endpoints as described in the backend README
